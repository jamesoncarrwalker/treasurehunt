# treasurehunt
a fun game, find the treasure as quickly as you can

This is an example of a pre-interview task I was asked to complete.

The brief was to create a game which will give a user feedback on how far awat they are
from the goal (I decided on the pirate theme myself).

To set this up you will have to set up a routing system, and your own log in.

The DB structure is included.  Really this is only to demonstrate the idea behind how the game works
you cna play the game at jamesmcarr.co.uk/treasurehunt
